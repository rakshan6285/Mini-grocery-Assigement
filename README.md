#  Mini Grocery App

A simple mobile app I built using React Native. Users can browse grocery items and add them to a cart.

#  What I Built

A grocery shopping app with two main screens:
- Home Screen: Shows grocery categories and items
- Cart Screen: Shows items in shopping cart

#  How to Run

1. Install dependencies: npm install
2. Start the app: npm start
3. Scan QR code with Expo Go app on your phone

# What I Used

- React Native: To build the mobile app
- Expo: To make development easier
- Zustand: To manage the shopping cart data
- JSON: To store grocery item information

# What the App Does

- Shows different grocery categories (fruits, vegetables, etc.)
- Displays items in a grid layout
- Lets users add/remove items from cart
- Works on both Android and iPhone

#  What I Learned

- How to build mobile apps with React Native
- How to create reusable components
- How to manage data between different screens
- How to make apps work on different phone sizes

# How I Built It

I broke the app into small parts:
1. Components: Reusable pieces like buttons and lists
2. Screens: Main pages (Home and Cart)
3. Data: Grocery item information stored in JSON
4. State: Shopping cart data that updates when items are added/removed

# Design Features

- Clean, simple interface
- Easy to use buttons and lists
- Visual feedback when items are added to cart
- Works well on different screen sizes

# My Learning Journey

This was my first React Native project. I learned by:
- Reading documentation
- Watching tutorials
- Testing on my phone
- Fixing bugs step by step

# What I Want to Learn Next

- User accounts and login
- Database storage
- Push notifications
- Better app performance

#  About This Project

I built this to learn mobile app development. It's simple but shows I can:
- Build working mobile apps
- Organize code properly
- Solve problems independently
- Learn new technologies
